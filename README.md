# RL_Data_Project
I developed this project as a way to merge my likeness for Rocket League with practical implementation of VBA code in Excel and working with Excel in general. My primary focus for this ongoing project is to keep as much code as I can in VBA, and not rely too heavily on cell functions to push me out of my comfort zone and build familiarity with VBA.
